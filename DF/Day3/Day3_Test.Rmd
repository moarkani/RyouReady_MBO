Preparation: Please install `tidyverse` and `stringr` library before start.

```{r, message=FALSE}

The DNA or RNA string for each question are also available in a separate text file in Brightspace entitled **Day3_Strings_Test.**

## Q1: Splicing out introns

Here's a short section of genomic DNA:

"ATCGATCGATCGATCGACTGACTAGTCATAGCTATGCATGTAGCTACTCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCATGCTATCATCGATCGATATCGATGCATCGACTACTAT"

It comprises two exons and an intron. The first exon runs from the start of the sequence to the 50 character, and the second exon runs from the 73 character to 95 of the sequence.

Write a program that will calculate what percentage of the DNA sequence is [coding]{.underline}.

-   Calculate the length of each exons

-   Calculate the length of DNA

-   Calculate the Coding DNA (percentage)

## Q2: Splicing out introns

Using the data from part Q1 and, write a program that will print out the original genomic DNA sequence with coding bases(Exons) in uppercase and non-coding bases(Introns) in lowercase.

hint: you can use `tolower()` function in order to have bases in lowercase.

"ATCGATCGATCGATCGACTGACTAGTCATAGCTATGCATGTAGCTACTCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCATGCTATCATCGATCGATATCGATGCATCGACTACTAT"

## Q3: From DNA to Amino Acid

There is a DNA string.

DNA:

"AACTTACTTCCTAGGATGCTGATGCAGGTTCACATGCTGAAACTCCGGATAGGATGGACTATGGCTAGATATATAGCTAGCTAGCTAGGATTATATAGCTAGCTAGCTGACTAGCTAGAGATGGATC"

Write a program that will

1.  **Create the complement of this DNA sequence. (**cDNA**)**

2.  **Calculate CG content in cDNA in [percentage]{.underline}.** *(Amount of C + Amount of G)*

3.  **Transcribe the cDNA to RNA. (***Note: A -\> U, C -\> G, U -\> A, G -\> C* **)**

4.  **Splicing process. (RNA to spliced-RNA)**

    *The first exon runs from the start of the sequence to the 40 character, and the second exon runs from the 89 character to 127 of the sequence. Write a program that will print just the coding regions(Exons) of the RNA sequence.*

    **Create the RNA which only include of Exons(without Introns)**

5.  **Write a program that will calculate what percentage of the RNA sequence is coding** *(Length of Spliced RNA)***.**

6.  **Create tRNA from Spliced-mRNA. (The complement of the Spliced mRNA)**

7.  **Detect all the start and stop codons and replace with `met` and `stop` respectively**:

    **Find the start codon (`AUG)` and [replace]{.underline} it with `met`.**

    **Find the stop codon (`UAG)` and [replace]{.underline} it with `STOP`.**
